ðŸ§  Machine Learning Daily Challenges

Welcome to my Machine Learning Daily Challenges repository! ðŸš€
Iâ€™ve started uploading daily ML practice problems, projects, and experiments to document my learning journey and improve my skills in:

Data preprocessing and feature engineering

Model building & evaluation (Regression, Classification, Clustering, etc.)

Deep Learning & Neural Networks

Real-world problem solving with Python (using Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, etc.)

ðŸ“… Goal: Upload one challenge or project every day
ðŸ“Š Focus: Hands-on learning, consistent progress, and sharing insights

ðŸ’¡ Feel free to explore, contribute, or suggest ideas!
