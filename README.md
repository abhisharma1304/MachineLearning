üß† Machine Learning Daily Challenges

Welcome to my Machine Learning Daily Challenges repository!
This repository is part of my ongoing journey to strengthen my understanding of machine learning algorithms, data analysis techniques, and model development through consistent daily practice. Every day, I upload a new challenge, experiment, or mini-project related to different areas of machine learning.

The primary goal of this repository is to build a habit of daily learning, explore a variety of machine learning concepts, and create a personal reference for future projects. Each challenge focuses on solving a specific problem ‚Äî from basic data preprocessing to advanced model tuning and deep learning. Over time, this collection will evolve into a rich resource of practical examples, datasets, and code snippets that demonstrate real-world ML applications.

üìò What You‚Äôll Find Here

Daily ML Challenges: Hands-on exercises covering regression, classification, clustering, and recommendation systems.

Model Implementation: Practical examples of algorithms such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, K-Means, and Neural Networks.

Data Analysis: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), visualization, and feature engineering techniques.

Deep Learning: Experiments with TensorFlow and PyTorch for building neural networks and CNN models.

Mini Projects: Real-world datasets and problem statements for end-to-end ML workflows.

üß© Tools and Technologies

Languages: Python

Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch
